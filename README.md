## Hello! 

### What's this?
I decided to challenge myself to do **at least** one LeetCode per day for a year.

### But Whyyyyy? Interview prep?
Honestly? I'm not too sure. Like, yes, of course this will be good for coding interviews, and of course I am reading [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25707092-cracking-the-coding-interview), but honestly, I am doing this because I recently found new passion in the field of software development since starting my co-op, and I wanted to brush up on my C++ skills, my first **professionally** taught language, as well as the concepts of data structures and algorithms

### Should We Hire You?
If you're reading this and asking that question, yes 😉
